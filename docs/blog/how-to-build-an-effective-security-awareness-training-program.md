**Cybersecurity threats** evolve rapidly, with *cybercriminals* targeting *enterprise networks* and *applications*. A *comprehensive security awareness training program* educates employees on *latest threats* and *best practices*, preventing *data breaches* and fostering a *culture of security*. This guide outlines steps to create an effective *training program* for all employees.

## Step 1: Define the Scope

| Best Practices        | Teach *strong passwords* and *password managers*, avoiding *public Wi-Fi* for *sensitive tasks*, and keeping *software updated* to patch *vulnerabilities*.                                                        |
| Company Policies      | Highlight *data protection policies* for *sensitive information* and prompt *suspicious activity* reporting.                                                                                                       |
| Incident Response     | Instruct on *whom to notify* during a *cyberattack* and steps to *minimize impact* of a *data breach*.                                                                                                             |

**Training Formats**:
- *Online modules*: Self-paced, accessible anywhere.
- *In-person sessions*: Interactive, with *real-time feedback*.
- *Simulated phishing attacks*: Train employees to recognize *phishing emails*.
- *Posters/newsletters*: Quick reminders of *best practices*.
- *Gamification*: Use *quizzes* or *challenges* to boost *engagement*.

**Examples**:
- Use *real-life cyberattacks* (e.g., ransomware incidents) to highlight *risks*.
- Showcase *consequences* of *breaches* to emphasize *importance*.

> **Key Content**: *Relevant, engaging content* drives *employee awareness* and *compliance*.

## Step 3: Deliver the Training

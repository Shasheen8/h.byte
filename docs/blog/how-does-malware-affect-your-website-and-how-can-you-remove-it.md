**Website malware** is a pervasive threat that can *compromise* a website’s *functionality*, *security*, and *reputation*. Often *hidden* among *legitimate code*, *malware* can go *undetected* until it causes significant *disruption*. This post explores the *symptoms* of *malware infection*, *indicators* to identify it, and *technical steps* to *clean* an infected website.

## Symptoms of Website Malware

*Malware* can manifest in various disruptive ways, including:

- **Unexpected Redirects**:
    - Opening a browser loads an *unfamiliar website* that *redirects* to multiple other sites.
- **Unwanted Pop-Ups**:
    - Numerous *unknown pop-ups* appear, overwhelming the user experience.
- **Abnormal Activity**:
    - *Disk* or *network activity* spikes, indicating *unauthorized connections* or *data transfers*.

> **Key Warning**: These *symptoms* suggest *malware* is actively *compromising* your website’s *integrity*.

## Indicators of Malware Infection

*Malware* often leaves *traces* that can be identified with careful inspection. Common *indicators* include:

- **Unrecognized Admin Users in CMSs**:
    - *Malware payloads* create *backdoors*, such as *unauthorized admin accounts* in *Content Management Systems (CMSs)* like *WordPress*.
    - *Backdoors* allow *attackers* to *re-enter* a site even after *vulnerabilities* are patched.
- **Strange or Misspelled File Names**:
    - Suspicious files like `jdD9dcL2XXdR.php` are obvious red flags.
    - *Attackers* may use *deceptively named files* (e.g., `wp-lood.php` instead of *WordPress’s* `wp-load.php`) to blend with *legitimate files*.
- **Bad Search Engine Results**:
    - *Malware* manipulates *search engine results* to *boost unrelated sites* or display *foreign characters* in your *domain’s Google results*, harming *SEO* and *online reputation*.
- **Website Errors**:
    - *Foreign code* injected into *existing code* can cause *site failures* due to a single *misplaced character*.
    - *Errors* can make *malware* easier to *spot* but indicate *underlying issues*.

> **Key Insight**: *Malware indicators* often *hide in plain sight*, requiring *vigilant monitoring* to detect.

## Cleaning an Infected Website

*Removing malware* from a website is a *technical process* that demands *knowledge* and *caution*. Follow these steps to *clean* an infected site:

1. **Create a Backup**:
    - Before modifying *files* or *databases*, ensure a *complete backup* is available for *restoration* if needed.
2. **Investigate the Issue**:
    - In a *shared hosting environment*, check for *daily malware scans* conducted by the *host*.
    - Look for a `malware.txt` file in the *hosting root*, which lists *paths* to *infected files*.
3. **Access Files**:
    - Connect to your *files* using a tool like *FTP* (e.g., *FileZilla*).
4. **Scan and Analyze Files**:
    - Use *VirusTotal* to *scan infected files* for *malware signatures*.
    - Analyze *code snippets* with tools like:
        - *MobileFish* (deobfuscator).
        - *Unphp* or *Quttera* (decoders).
5. **Handle Infected Files**:
    - *Malware* often infects *legitimate files* critical to site functionality.
    - Avoid *deleting* infected *core files*, as this can cause *site issues*.
    - Replace *infected files* with *clean versions* from a *trusted source*.
    - Use *DiffChecker* to *compare* *infected code snippets* with *clean file contents* to identify *malicious code*.
6. **Test and Verify**:
    - After *cleaning*, test the *website* to ensure *functionality* is restored and *malware* is removed.

> **Key Challenge**: *Cleaning malware* requires *precision* to avoid *disrupting legitimate functionality*.

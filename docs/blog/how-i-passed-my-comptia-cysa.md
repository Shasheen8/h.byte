- **Security Operations and Monitoring**:
    - Analyze *data* for *continuous security monitoring*.
    - Enforce *configuration changes* to improve *security controls*.
- **Incident Response**:
    - Apply *proper incident response procedures*.
    - Analyze *indicators of compromise (IoCs)*.
    - Utilize *basic digital forensics techniques*.

> **Key Focus**: *Practical skills* in *threat detection* and *incident response* are critical for *exam success*.

## My Preparation Approach

My preparation for the *CS0-002 exam* spanned *4 months*, with a structured yet flexible approach:

1. **Month 1: Passive Reading**:
    - Focused on *familiarizing* with *terms* and *concepts* through light reading.
2. **Month 2: Active Reading**:
    - Immersed in *exam modules*, emphasizing *Incident Response*, *Security Operations and Monitoring*, *Digital Forensics*, and *Technical Hardware Assurance*.
3. **Month 3: Procrastination and Passive Reading**:
    - Faced setbacks due to *illness* and *other responsibilities*.
    - Continued *passive learning* by listening to *video training* on my phone.
4. **Month 4: All-In**:
    - Created a *daily study schedule* with *spaced repetition* and *active recall*.
    - Took *10–12 practice tests* in the final two weeks to simulate *exam conditions*.

**Study Habits**:
- As a *nocturnal learner*, I studied at *night* to avoid *distractions*.
- Emphasized *spaced repetition* (reviewing material at intervals) and *active recall* (testing memory actively).

> **Key Strategy**: A *consistent schedule* and *active recall* overcame *setbacks* and boosted *retention*.

## Choosing Study Materials

I carefully selected *study materials* to maximize *exam readiness*:

- **Jason Dion’s Udemy Course**:
    - Comprehensive *video training* with a *study guide* and *exam tips* in short snippets.
    - Well-structured and focused, avoiding the overwhelm of multiple courses.
- **Jason Dion Practice Tests**:
    - Included *6 practice tests*, though some questions were *ambiguous*.
- **CompTIA CertMaster**:
    - Offered *practice tests* with *detailed explanations* for answer choices.
    - Closely aligned with the *exam format*, including *performance-based questions (PBQs)*.
- **CompTIA Self-Paced Labs**:
    - Provided *hands-on practice* in *Networking*, *Incident Response*, *Email Monitoring*, and *Digital Forensics*.
    - Essential for mastering *PBQs*.
- **Mike Chapple Practice Tests**:
    - Supplemental resource for *question variety*.

**Focus on Practice Tests**:
- Prioritized *practice tests* to test *memory* and *decision-making* under *exam-like conditions*.
- *CertMaster* stood out for its *explanations* and *PBQ alignment*, aiding *time management*.

> **Key Resource**: *CertMaster* and *self-paced labs* provide the *closest simulation* of the *CySA+ exam*.

## Focused Areas

I concentrated on *key technical areas* to build *confidence*:

- *Incident Response*: Mastering *procedures* and *indicators of compromise*.
- *Security Operations and Monitoring*: Analyzing *logs* and applying *configuration changes*.
- *Digital Forensics*: Understanding *basic techniques* for *evidence collection*.
- *Technical Hardware Assurance*: Ensuring *secure hardware configurations*.
- *Performance-Based Questions (PBQs)*: Practicing *hands-on tasks* to improve *speed* and *accuracy*.

**Myth Debunked**:
- A common belief is that *85%+* on *practice tests* guarantees a *pass*. I disregarded this, focusing on *fundamental concepts* to avoid confusion from *twisted keywords* (e.g., *Malware* vs. *Polymorphic Malware*, *hex codes* for *URL decoding*).

> **Key Tip**: Master *core concepts* to navigate *confusing questions* and *PBQs*.

## Note-Taking Strategy

My *note-taking approach* was tailored for *effective learning*:

- **Notion Notes**:
    - Covered *core concepts* in a *structured format* for easy review.
    - Focused on *keywords* and *scenarios* likely to appear in the exam.
- **Handwritten Notes**:
    - Reinforced *understanding* through *manual writing*.
- **Practice Test Insights**:
    - Noted *explanations* from *CertMaster* to clarify *correct answers*.

**Scoring Insight**:
- My *practice test scores* plateaued below *80%* until I prioritized *PBQs*, which are a *significant portion* of the exam.
- Aimed for *800+/900* (not just the *750* passing score) to build *confidence* and avoid a *minimalist mindset*.

> **Key Method**: *Personalized notes* and *PBQ practice* are essential for *exam readiness*.

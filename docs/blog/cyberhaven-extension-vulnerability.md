In late December 2024, Cyberhaven, a data loss prevention company, experienced a security breach involving its Chrome browser extension. The incident was part of a broader campaign targeting multiple Chrome extensions across various organizations.Incident OverviewOn December 24, 2024, a Cyberhaven employee fell victim to a phishing attack that compromised their Google Chrome Web Store access. The attacker exploited this access to publish a malicious version (24.10.4) of Cyberhaven‚Äôs Chrome extension. This compromised extension was active from December 25, 1:32 AM UTC, until December 26, 2:50 AM UTC, during which it could exfiltrate sensitive user data, including authenticated sessions and cookies, to a rogue domain (cyberhavenext[.]pro). The malicious extension contained two altered JavaScript files:worker.js: This script contacted the command and control (C&C) server at cyberhavenext[.]pro to download a configuration stored in Chrome‚Äôs local storage. It also registered listeners to handle events from content.js and execute HTTP requests as directed.content.js: This script monitored user interactions and DOM changes, focusing on specific websites. It communicated with worker.js to relay information back to the attacker, facilitating the exfiltration of sensitive data.

Some extra details we got from Cyberhaven (only after reaching out to them) cc @tuckner on the config keys below The extension (version 24.10.6) is currently pending review by Google and will be ready to push in the next few hoursWe intend to push the update to the Chrome‚Ä¶‚Äî solst/ICE (@IceSolst) December 26, 2024 CyberHaven malicious extension (24.10.4) details üßµA new content script was added to the extension manifest which runs at the start of every webpage pic.twitter.com/ot6fxcXQvP‚Äî tuckner (@tuckner) December 26, 2024 

The attack vector involved a phishing email that led the employee to authorize a malicious OAuth application named ‚ÄúPrivacy Policy Extension.‚Äù This authorization allowed the attacker to upload the compromised extension to the Chrome Web Store. Notably, the employee had Google Advanced Protection and multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled yet did not receive an MFA prompt during the attack, indicating a sophisticated bypass of security measures.Post Incident Analysis and RemediationScenario 1: Extension Controlled Using Browser Security on ChromeChallenges in this scenario: Limited control over the extension behavior. Dependency on Chrome‚Äôs built-in extension management policies for mitigation.Users may unwittingly install the malicious extension if not preemptively blocked.Actions Security Teams Should TakeAnalyze and Block the Extension	‚Ä¢	Audit Installed Extensions: Use tools like Chrome Browser Cloud Management (CBCM) to generate an inventory of extensions across managed endpoints.	‚Ä¢	Create an Extension Blocklist: Block the malicious extension by its unique extension ID using Chrome policies:

{
    "ExtensionSettings": {
        "*": {
            "installation_mode": "allowed"
        },
        "malicious_extension_id": {
            "installation_mode": "blocked"
        }
    }
}

Force Removal: Enforce a policy to uninstall the extension from all managed browsers  2. Enhance User AwarenessNotify users about the malicious extension and provide steps to verify its presence and remove it if necessary.Rotate user credentials for necessary applications.Educate users on how to spot potentially malicious extensions and encourage the use of vetted tools. 3. Monitor Browser ActivityDNS and Network Traffic: Monitor for communication to suspicious domains associated with the extension.Anomaly Detection: Look for unusual browser behaviors, such as excessive CPU usage or unexpected web requests originating from endpoints. 4. Restrict Extension PermissionsImplement strict permissions policies for Chrome extensions, allowing only those necessary for legitimate business purposes.Use enterprise extension allowlisting to preapprove a set of trusted extensions.Scenario 2: Extension Controlled via MDM with No Log VisibilityChallenges in this scenario: Complete control of the extension by the third-party provider means no transparency in its operations.Logs and telemetry are unavailable for real-time monitoring or incident response.Mitigating the issue might/will involve third-party coordination.Actions Security Teams Should TakeEvaluate the Third-Party VendorDemand Transparency: Request detailed reports and security assessments from the Vendor, including evidence of a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC).Review Incident Response Plans: Ensure the Vendor has robust incident handling mechanisms.Compliance Checks: Verify that the Vendor adheres to relevant security frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).    2. Control Distribution and UseRestrict to Necessary Systems: Deploy the extension only on devices, accounts, or browsers that require it.Apply Usage Policies: Use MDM policies to enforce strict usage controls, such as disabling access during off-hours or limiting access to critical sensitive systems.    3. Monitor Through Alternative MeansEndpoint Behavior Monitoring: Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools (e.g., CrowdStrike) to flag suspicious activities triggered by the extension.DNS and Traffic Analysis: Identify unusual traffic patterns to known C2 or malicious domains and block outbound connections.    4. Coordinate with the VendorNotify the Vendor of the detected vulnerability immediately and request:Do root cause analysis.Updates or patches to the extension.Specific mitigation steps for customers.    5. Containment and RemovalIf the vulnerability poses a severe threat:Revoke the extension‚Äôs access via MDM policies.Implement emergency procedures to uninstall the extension across all endpoints.Use MDM to enforce the usage of a secure alternative tool.Long-Term Recommendations for Both ScenariosAdopt Browser Management Tools: Use CBCM (Chrome Browser Cloud Management) or similar tools to enforce strict security policies and gain visibility into browser-related risks.Integrate MDM Logs with SIEM: Leverage third-party integrations or proxy-based monitoring to collect relevant telemetry and add visibility to blind spots.Vendor Management Program: Regularly review third-party tools for vulnerabilities. Enforce contractual agreements mandating compliance with security best practices and prompt remediation of discovered issues.Simulate Extension Attacks: Conduct red-team exercises focusing on malicious browser extensions to test organizational response plans.Alternative Solutions: If the third-party Vendor fails to address concerns, explore secure alternatives vetted through rigorous testing and analysis.In both scenarios, organizations can significantly mitigate risks associated with third-party browser extensions by combining proactive management, user education, and vendor collaboration.References: https://www.cyberhaven.com/engineering-blog/cyberhavens-preliminary-analysis-of-the-recent-malicious-chrome-extension https://x.com/cstanley/status/1872365853318225931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872365853318225931%7Ctwgr%5E099ab0895374dd9ccc104491a5945a5ac3385b0c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulnu.com%2Fp%2Fbreaking-cyberhaven-chrome-extension-compromised https://therecord.media/cyberhaven-hack-google-chrome-extension https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/16-chrome-extensions-hacked-exposing.html
